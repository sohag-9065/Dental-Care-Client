I am so much more confident and I smile with ease now.The ambience at Dentzz is very relaxing and soothing, with the soft music playing in the background, its almost like being in a lounge, whilst I am being grilled, with no pain.The result â€“ I am a new laughing Buddha, amongst my family and friends."
